**Display port:** Port which also outputs audio and video

**DRAM:** Dynamic Random Access Memory

**Drivers:** The drivers contain the instructions our CPU needs to understand external devices like keyboards, webcams, printers

**DVI:** DVI cables generally just output video

**Electrostatic discharge:** Electrostatic discharge is a sudden and momentary flow of electric current between two electrically charged objects caused by contact, an electrical short or dielectric breakdown

**External Data Bus (EDB):** It's a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer

**Factory reset:** Resetting a device to the settings it came with from the factory

**Form factor:** A mathematical way to compensate for irregularities in the shape of an object by using a ratio between its volume and height

**Hard drive:** It is a long term memory component that holds all of our data, which can include music, pictures, applications

**Hardware:** External or internal devices and equipment that help you perform major functions

**HDD (Hard disk drive):** Hard disk drives, or HDDs, use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information

**HDMI:** A type of cable that outputs both video and audio

**Heatsink:** It is used to dissipate heat from our CPU

**Instruction set:** A list of instructions that our CPU is able to run

**ITX (Information Technology eXtended):** A form factor for motherboards that is much smaller than ATX boards

**Land Grid Array (LGA):** It is a type of CPU socket that stick out of the motherboard

**Lightning adaptor:** One of the standard power, data and display connector types used in mobile devices

**Mb/s:** megabit per second, which is a unit of data transfer rate

**Memory controller chip (MCC):** A bridge between the CPU and the RAM

**Micro display port:** One of the standard power, data and display connector types used in mobile devices 

**Micro HDMI:** One of the standard power, data and display connector types used in mobile devices

**Mini HDMI:** One of the standard power, data and display connector types used in mobile devices 

**Mini USB:** One of the standard power, data and display connector types used in mobile devices

**Motherboard:** The body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together

**Northbridge:** interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards

**NVMe (NVM Express):** interface standard which allows greater throughput of data and increased efficiency

**Overclocking:** it increases the rate of your CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks

**PCI Express:** Peripheral Component Interconnect Express

**Peripherals:** the external devices which we connect to our computer that add functionality, like: a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor

**Pin Grid Array (PGA):** CPU socket where the pins are located on the processor itself

**Ports:** Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer

**POST (Power On Self Test):** It figures out what hardware is on the computer

**Power supply:** Converts electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use

**Programs:** Basic instructions that tell the computer what to do

**RAM:** Random Access Memory

**Registers:** An accessible location for storing the data that our CPU works with

**Reimaging:** The process of reimaging involves wiping and reinstalling an operating system using a disk image which is a copy of an operating system

**Return merchandise authorization (RMA):** The process of receiving returned merchandise and authorizing a refund

**ROM chip (Read Only Memory):** A read-only memory chip where the BIOS is stored

**RPM:** Revolutions per minute

**Safe operating temperature:** The temperature range in which rechargeable batteries must be kept in order to avoid damage

**SATA:** The most popular serial ATA drive, which uses one cable for data transfers

**SDRAM:** It stands for Synchronous DRAM, this type of RAM is synchronized to our systems' clock speed allowing quicker processing of data

**SOC (System On a Chip):** Packs the CPU, Ram, and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip

**Southbridge:** It maintains our IO or input/output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices that input and output data

**SSD:** Solid State Drive

**Standoffs:** Used to raise and attach your motherboard to the case

**Thermal paste:** A substance used to better connect our CPU and heat sink, so the heat transfers from to the other better
